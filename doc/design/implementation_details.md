# Implementation Details

This document provides details about the implementation of the `gox-helix` framework.

## Database Schema and Code Generation

We will be using `sqlc` to generate type-safe Go code from our SQL schema. `sqlc` is a command-line tool that generates Go code from SQL queries.

### Why `sqlc`?

*   **Type Safety:** `sqlc` generates type-safe Go code, which helps to prevent SQL injection attacks and other common database-related bugs.
*   **Developer Productivity:** `sqlc` automates the process of writing boilerplate database code, which frees up developers to focus on more important tasks.
*   **Maintainability:** `sqlc` makes it easy to keep the Go code in sync with the database schema.

### Workflow

The workflow for using `sqlc` will be as follows:

1.  **Define the database schema:** We will define the database schema in a set of SQL files.
2.  **Write SQL queries:** We will write SQL queries for all of our database operations.
3.  **Run `sqlc`:** We will run `sqlc` to generate Go code from the schema and queries.
4.  **Use the generated code:** We will use the generated Go code in our application to interact with the database.

### `sqlc.yaml` Configuration

We will use a `sqlc.yaml` file to configure `sqlc`. This file will specify the location of our schema and query files, as well as other options.

```yaml
version: "2"
sql:
  - engine: "mysql"
    queries: "db/queries.sql"
    schema: "db/schema.sql"
    gen:
      go:
        package: "db"
        out: "db"
```

This is a starting point for the implementation details. We will add more details as we proceed with the implementation.
