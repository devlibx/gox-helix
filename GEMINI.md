# gox-helix

A Go project.

- whn i ask for git commit.  add the chages files, generate a good commit message with details. and git commit and push
- do not git commit untill i specificially do this.
- Design documents are located in the doc/design folder.
- The implementation_details.md file contains information about the implementation of the framework.

## Current Work Status

We are currently refactoring the distributed locking mechanism into a generic, reusable Go package. This involves:

1.  **New Package Structure:** The lock implementation is now located under `pkg/common/lock`, with MySQL-specific details in `pkg/common/lock/database/mysql`.
2.  **Schema Updates:** The `locks` table has been renamed to `helix_locks` and a new `status` column (ENUM: `active`, `inactive`, `deletable`) has been added to manage lock states.
3.  **SQLC Configuration:** `sqlc.yaml` and `queries.sql` have been updated for the new lock package, and `RETURNING` clauses were removed for MySQL compatibility.
4.  **Interface Definition:** A `Locker` interface has been defined in `pkg/common/lock/lock.go` to abstract the locking operations.

## Next Steps

To continue, we need to:

1.  **Update Lock Queries:** Modify `pkg/common/lock/database/mysql/queries.sql` to incorporate the `status` column and add queries for status transitions.
2.  **Regenerate SQLC Code:** Run `sqlc generate` for the updated lock package.
3.  **Implement Locker Interface:** Implement the `Locker` interface in `pkg/common/lock/database/mysql/lock.go` using the `sqlc`-generated code.
4.  **Write Detailed Tests:** Develop comprehensive end-to-end tests for the lock package in `pkg/common/lock/database/mysql/lock_test.go`, using a real MySQL database and environment variables for configuration.
